The binary method converts the usage of each of the single words within a given text into either a 0 (not used) or a 1 (used one or more times). The uncorrected method is based on the percentage of total words that each of the category words are used. The binary method has the potential to overestimate reliability based on the length of texts; the uncorrected method tends to  underestimate reliability based on the highly variable base rates of word usage within any given category. \n",

Once you say something, you generally donâ€™t need to say it again in the same paragraph or essay. The nature of discourse, then, is we usually say something and then move on to the next topic. Saying the same thing over and over again is generally bad form.\n",
